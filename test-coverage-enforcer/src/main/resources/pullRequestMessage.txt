## Purpose
Generate unit test coverage information and add a rule to stop the build if the coverage threshold have not met

## Goals
Integrate Jacoco Maven plugin with Maven Surefire plugin to generate unit test coverage information as well as unit test coverage checking

## Approach
-- Invoke jacoco maven plugin with coverage check in the parent pom under <build><pluginManagement>
-- Inherit jacoco maven plugin in child poms
-- Invoke jacoco maven plugin with coverage check in a non-multi-module maven project pom file under <build>
-- Reformat pom files for proper indentation and formatting
* If any part of existing jacoco implementation is present during this procedure, nothing will be added or modified.
* However jacoco argument line for Maven Surefire plugin will replace existing Maven Surefire plugin arguments.
