## Purpose
Generate unit test coverage information and add a rule to stop the build if the coverage threshold have not met

## Goals
Integrate Jacoco Maven plugin with Maven Surefire plugin to generate unit test coverage information as well as unit test coverage checking

## Approach
-- Invoke jacoco maven plugin with coverage check in the parent pom under <build><pluginManagement>
-- Inherit jacoco maven plugin in child poms
-- Invoke jacoco maven plugin with coverage check in a non-multi-module maven project pom file under <build>
If any part of existing jacoco implementation is present during this procedure, nothing will be added or modified.
However jacoco argument line for Maven Surefire plugin will replace existing Maven Surefire plugin arguments.
