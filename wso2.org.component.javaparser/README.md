This project for refactoring scr doclets (doc comments) to SCR Java annotations  and add those things to component file as osgi annotations.

Algorithm

    1. Refactoring scr doc comment and convert it to OSGI annotations

    2. Replace the maven-scr-plugin from root pom dependency management

    3. If maven-scr-plugin is hard coded at the component pom then remove it

    4. Add the  org.apache.felix.scr.ds-annotations as dependency for each component pom if there has any declarative service

    5. Add the org.apache.felix.scr.ds-annotations as dependency for root pom

    6. Add the apache.felix.scr.ds.annotations.version(1.2.4) and  maven.scr.plugin.version(1.16.0) to parent pom properties.
